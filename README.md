## Quantum-classical Duality between Heisenberg and Ruijsenaars-Schneider Models

### Abstract

We examine a quantum-classical duality between inhomogeneous Heisenberg models and rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider models building on observations of \cite{article:gorsky:2014} and \cite{book:arutyunov:betheAnsatz}. We show how generalized Schur-Weyl duality between the Yangian and the degenerate affine Hecke algebra provides a clear structural reason for the existence of this duality, also giving a generalization to spins in non-fundamental representations. Employing the theory of degenerate double affine Hecke algebras, we extend this point of view to a quantum-classical duality between trigonometric Gaudin and Calogero-Moser models, showing how all four models arise from two $S$-dual representations of the loop Yangian. Finally, we give a geometric picture of generalized Schur-Weyl duality that makes apparent how all of these models emerge naturally in four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory when constructed as a 2-functorial quantum field theory.
